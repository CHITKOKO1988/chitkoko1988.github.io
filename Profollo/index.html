                     In the year 103 of the Mahā Sakkarāja Era (588 BC), after attaining enlightenment as the Gotama Buddha, he journeyed through the Seven Places of Enlightenment-Attainment. During this time, two merchant brothers named Tapussa and Bhallika from the Ukkalāpajanapada offered him rice cakes and honey. The Buddha graciously gave them eight strands of his hair. The brothers carried these sacred relics back to Ukkalāpa. Upon their return,the King of Ukkalāpa, along with the townspeople, welcomed and revered these relics. The inhabitants of Ukalāpa, under the guidance of King Ukalāpa, enshrined the sacred relics of previous Buddhas at the Siṅguttara Hill. These relics included the staff of Kakusandha Buddha, the water filter of Koṇāgamana Buddha, the robe of Kassapa Buddha, and eight strands of hair from Gotama Buddha. They constructed and venerated the Shwedagon Pagoda, which stands at a height of 66 meters (216 feet) with dimensions of 44 meters by 20 meters. Due to the presence of the relics from these four Buddhas, the pagoda earned the title “Shwedagon Pagoda of the Four Sacred Relics. From approximately 600 BCE to the 14th century CE, 32 successive kings of Ukalapa maintained and enhanced the Shwedagon Pagoda. From 1372 CE onwards, it was further preserved and renovated by kings such as King Byinnya U, King Byinnya Yan, and King Byinnya Kyan Htaw. In 1453 CE, under the reign of Queen Shin Saw Pu, the height of the pagoda was increased to 302 feet. In 1774 CE, during the reign of King Hsinbyushin, it was raised to its current height of 326 feet (99. 36 meters).

                    The Kyaiktiyo Pagoda, today also known as the Golden Rock Pagoda is located on top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo at 3615 feet (1102 meters) above sea level, in the Mon State and approximately 130 miles (210 km) from the city of Yangon. The Pagoda was built more than 2500 years ago. Legend has it that the Pagoda was built on a Hair relic that was given to a hermit by Buddha Himself. The hermit treasured the sacred Hair in his hair knot until he found a boulder resembling his own head on which he could build a pagoda to enshrine it. In the Mon language “Kyaik” means “pagoda” and “Yo” means “to carry on the head” “Ithi” in Pali means “hermit”. Thus the name “Kyaiktiyo” derived from “Kyaik-Thi-Yo” , “ the pagoda carried on a hermit’s head”. It can also be qualified as one of the wonders of the world by virtue of the fact that it sits uniquely at the apex of a huge, almost egg shaped granitic boulder. This boulder (now completely gilded) is precariously perched on a projecting tabular rock. The gilded boulder and the rock table are two separate pieces, the boulder actually balancing off the extreme verge of the sloping surface of the rock and overhanging it by nearly half its length
